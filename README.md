# Current Weather Application

### Description

The Current Weather Application is a simple simulation of a classic Weather Forecast  website. The app user has the ability to access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities. He can do that be inputting the city name, country name or  the country code in the search bar on the top site of the page and confirming it by pressing "Enter".  The application  saves the 10  recent searchs (no matter if the are valid or not) in the history list sorted from the most recent to the oldest search, if he wants to check his search history to he can inspect it in the console. If the user has over ten searches the app it automatically removes the oldest search input and replaces it with the newest.

###How to run the application ? 

Before you get started, make sure that you have installed node.js, if u have  not  you can get it for free from [Download NodeJS](http:/https://nodejs.org/en// "Download NodeJS") download the recommended version for most users, after you do that you can type in your terminal:

		--npm i react

 to install different types of packages we need and it sets everyting up for us, the whole environment we need, without us doing any other preparations (that's the highly recommended way to use).
 
 After you have installed and prepared everything, you can run your app by running:
 
 		-- npm start 
		
If the run is successfull, it will give you a link to open the app in your browser in local, your can do it by Alt+ Click at the link, for example in my case :

				Local: 	http://localhost:3000   

After opening , the app is ready to use.

### Some useful commands

		-- cd 'any directory name'    - you can use it to navigate beetweet different directories

		-- npm run build    -does nothing unless you specify what 'build' does in your package.json file. It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.
		
		--npm install  react-icons  -to use icons from the 'react-icons' website
		
###  Should be added soon into the project

	- clean search history button
	- local weather data for all parts of the city ( city parts depend on the size of the city)
	-show recent history button ( it should enable/disable the user to see his searches on the site instead/and the console)
	big feedback upgrade
